# Build Error Fix: Database Connection Issues

## Problem
The Next.js build process was failing due to two main issues:

1. **Prisma Client Generation**: The build was failing because the Prisma client wasn't generated before the build process started, causing `Cannot find module '.prisma/client/default'` errors.

2. **Database Connection During Build**: The build process was trying to prerender recipe pages during build time, which required a database connection. The error occurred because:
   - `generateStaticParams()` was trying to fetch recipe IDs from the database during build
   - The database connection was failing during the build process
   - This caused the build to fail with PrismaClientKnownRequestError

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Prisma Client Generation
- Updated build script to run `prisma generate` before `next build`
- Added `postinstall` script to ensure Prisma client is generated after dependencies are installed
- Created alternative build script (`scripts/build.sh`) for more robust build process
- Added Node.js version requirement (>=18.17.0) to package.json

### 2. Disabled Static Generation for Recipe Pages
- Removed `generateStaticParams()` function from `/app/recipes/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to force dynamic rendering
- This prevents database calls during build time

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around database operations
- Improved Prisma client configuration with better error handling
- Added connection health check function
- Added `safeDatabaseOperation` helper for build-time safety

### 4. Build Configuration Updates
- Updated `next.config.mjs` with better handling for database connection issues
- Added `onDemandEntries` configuration for better page management
- Created `vercel.json` for proper Vercel deployment configuration

### 5. Alternative Build Scripts
- Added `build:no-db` script that builds without database connection
- This allows builds to succeed even when database is unavailable

## How to Use

### For Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### For Production Build (with database)
```bash
npm run build
```

### For Production Build (without database)
```bash
npm run build:no-db
```

### For Deployment
Use the regular build command. The pages will be rendered dynamically at runtime, so the build will succeed even if the database is not available during build time.

### Alternative Build Script
```bash
npm run build:script
```
This uses the custom build script that handles Prisma client generation more robustly.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Build Reliability**: Builds will succeed regardless of database availability
2. **Runtime Performance**: Pages are still cached and optimized at runtime
3. **SEO Friendly**: Pages are still server-side rendered for good SEO
4. **Scalability**: No need to generate static pages for all recipes during build

## Node.js Version Requirement

This project requires Node.js version >= 18.17.0. You can:

1. Use `.nvmrc` file to automatically switch to the correct version:
   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

2. Or manually install/switch to Node.js 18.17.0 or higher:
   ```bash
   nvm install 18.17.0
   nvm use 18.17.0
   ```

## Database Connection

Make sure your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is properly configured:

```env
# For Supabase (connection pooling)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&sslmode=require"

# For direct connection (migrations)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require"
```

## Notes

- The recipe pages will now be rendered dynamically at runtime
- This provides better performance for frequently updated content
- The build process is now more reliable and faster
- Database connection issues during build time are eliminated
